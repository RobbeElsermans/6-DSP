### Read the datasets
We have .csv, .part, opensignal, .mat and a .wav file

So we need to create a method (or object) to handle these sets of data.
Then convert them to an array of n dimensions.

## Wrong EMG sygnal sample frequency.
In the given dataset, the EMG signal was sampled at 1kHz. But in practice this sample rate was not 1kHz.

We can observe from the correlation graph below that the EMG signals correlates on to many places with the pseudo random sync signal.
ADD PICTURE OF CORRELATION

We came up with a way to extract the correct sample frequency from the EMG signal based on the base signal. These are the steps we took:
1. We resample the signals gien to 1kHz
2. Match the beginning of the 2 signals and cut everything before off. So we make the signals causale.
3. Do the same at the end of the signal where we cut off everything that comes after this.

In both 1 and 2 we work with a frame size (of 5001) so the correlation is less computationally heavy because when we correlate a signal with 20000 points, 
this gives us 40000 points to process.

4. The signals now start and stop at the same place. Because EMG is sampled at a different rate then the base signal, means that the EMG signal can have more points (sampled at a higher rate then 1kHz) or less points (sampled at a lower rate then 1kHz
