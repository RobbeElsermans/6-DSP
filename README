## Wrong EMG signal sample frequency.
In the given dataset, the EMG signal was sampled at 1kHz. But in practice this sample rate was not 1kHz.

We can observe from the correlation graph below that the EMG signals correlates on to many places with the pseudo random sync signal.

We came up with a way to extract the correct sample frequency from the EMG signal based on the base signal. These are the steps we took:
1. We resample the signals gien to 1kHz
2. Match the beginning of the 2 signals and cut everything before off. So we make the signals causale.
3. Do the same at the end of the signal where we cut off everything that comes after this.

> In both 2 and 3 we work with a frame size (of 5001) so the correlation is less computationally heavy because 
when we correlate a signal with 20000 points, this gives us 40000 points to process. We took 5001 because the lagg was situated around 4000 samples difference with the base signal. The +1 is to create even symmetry.

Below, the cross correlation where we see that the correlation spread is now arround the center (0) so this means that the signals are aligned at the beginnin and at the end.

4. The signals now start and stop at the same place. Because EMG is sampled at a different rate then the base signal, 
means that the EMG signal can have more points (sampled at a higher rate then 1kHz) or less points (sampled at a lower rate then 1kHz).

> from the used dataset, the EMG samples where lower in number then the base samples. This means that the EMG signal is sampled at a lower rate then 1kHz.

5. Based on this points, we can create the resample factor by dividing the amount of samples of the EMG by the amount of samples of the base signal.
We use the matklab <code> rat </code> function to give us 2 integer numbers. 

> We can also multiply this ratio with the current base sample rate on 1kHz to get the real 
sample frequency of the EMG signal. In our case, we came up with a sample rate of 999.355039Hz

6. We check once more the full correlation of the EMG signal with the bas.

## Aligning the data based on the pseudo random signal

When we found each sample frequency, we can continue with resampling the signals to 1kHz.

The steps we've taken:

1. Resample everything from the beginning with the new accuired sample rate.

2. Align all signals (this is for the base signal, perfusion, EMG and video capture) so that they start at 1 position in time (causale). To align, we do not alter the base sync signal. So if a signal starts behind the sync signal, we add zeros to the orther signal. If a signal start upfront, we delete samples of the other signal until the match is there.

3. From this align method, we receive a lag value. This lagg value is used to determine the beginning of all signals. So the maximum is used here. We cut everything off before the beginning to make the signals (and data) start at the same time.

4. When aligned propperly, we seek for the lowes number of samples in the 4 signals and curt everything off at the lowes number of samples. With this, we make sure that our signals start and stop at the same time.

> We align only the pseudo random signal and keep track of the indexes that where removed. Thus, we know which sync sample corresponds to which datapoint at the end.

As can be observed, all the noise arround is gone and we have a single point of correlation which means the sample rates are equal.

When observing a portion of the synchronization values, we see that they are aligned.
